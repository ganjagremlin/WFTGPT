Study B — Wᵣ Sequencing: mPFC/PCC ↔ Basal Ganglia During Narrative Re Ordering
Title
Striatal Support for Reflective Sequencing: Testing Wᵣ Narrative Integration via Online Re Ordering
Rationale (WFT → Neural)
WFT frames Wᵣ as reflective metabolization (sequencing/paradox holding). If sequencing is core, basal ganglia should couple with mPFC/PCC when narratives must be actively re ordered.
Hypotheses
1.	Coupling↑ with sequencing load: mPFC/PCC↔caudate/putamen connectivity increases when participants re order autobiographical micro episodes vs simple recall.
2.	Coherence link: Stronger coupling predicts higher linguistic coherence (temporal markers, causal connectives) and better delayed recall integration.
3.	Depression moderation: Elevated depressive symptoms → reduced coupling and lower coherence.
Design
•	Within subject: Recall (baseline) vs Re order (auditory prompts trigger time jumps).
•	Individual narratives generated pre scan; difficulty calibrated.
Participants
•	N=50 adults; dimensional depression sample (PHQ 9 range). Exclude neurological disorders, current mania/psychosis.
Tasks/Stimuli
•	8 autobiographical micro episodes (30–45s each), recorded pre scan.
•	In scanner: auditory prompts (“jump back 10s”, “jump to ending”) require live re sequencing.
Measures
•	fMRI (mPFC, PCC, caudate, putamen); audio recorded; post scan written summaries.
•	Language metrics: automated coherence indices (discourse markers, time words) + human ratings.
•	24h delayed recall.
Procedure
1.	Training and calibration.
2.	Scan: Recall blocks → Re order blocks (counterbalanced).
3.	Post scan summaries; day 2 recall online.
Primary Outcomes
•	FC(mPFC/PCC↔striatum) Recall vs Re order; coherence score Δ; coupling~coherence slope.
Secondary Outcomes
•	Delayed recall integration; moderation by PHQ 9.
Analysis Plan
•	GLM; PPI/β series connectivity; sliding window HMM for state switches.
•	NLP metrics (Coh Metrix style) + rater composites.
•	Mixed models: Coherence ~ FC + Condition + PHQ 9 + (1|subject).
Power & N
•	Expect medium effect (d≈0.5) on FC and coherence → N=50.
Exclusions
•	Speech artifacts >25% volumes; failure to follow prompts.
Prereg Items
•	ROIs, prompt schedule, coherence metric recipe, primary contrasts.
Ethics & Safety
•	Autobiographical but non traumatic memories; content screening.
Reentry Protocol
•	Brief breath cadence between blocks; debrief.
Data/Code
•	BIDS; audio + transcripts; code on OSF (de identified).

Notes for All Studies
•	Blinding: Analysts blinded to condition/group where feasible.
•	Multiple Comparisons: Limit to prereg ROIs; FDR for exploratory.
•	Reporting: Deviations from prereg documented; null results reported.
•	Generalization: Templates are modular—swap tasks for population specific variants (e.g., grief instead of trauma; dyadic tasks for Wₑ).

Study C — Collapse/Reentry Backbone: Thalamus ↔ DMN ↔ Salience Network
Title
A Triadic Model of Phase Change: Thalamic Gating of DMN–SN Switching During Disruption and Guided Reentry
Rationale (WFT → Neural)
WFT predicts a backbone for phase change: SN detects disruption (collapse onset), thalamus gates synchrony, DMN supports metabolization; guided reentry should normalize triadic dynamics.
Hypotheses
1.	Disruption: Mild cognitive/emotional disruption increases SN→DMN effective connectivity and reduces thalamus→DMN coupling.
2.	Reentry: Brief ritualized breath cadence restores thalamus→DMN coupling and reduces aberrant SN→DMN drive.
3.	Behavioral link: Magnitude of triadic normalization predicts faster subjective recovery and task performance rebound.
Design
•	Within subject A–B–A: Baseline → Disruption → Reentry; counterbalanced disruptor types (cognitive conflict; affective ambiguity).
Participants
•	N=48 healthy adults.
Tasks/Stimuli
•	Disruption blocks: (i) unsolved anagram sets with time pressure; (ii) ambiguous social feedback clips (non traumatic).
•	Reentry: 2 min paced breathing (6 cpm) + 30s stillness.
Measures
•	7T fMRI (thalamic nuclei: MD, ATN, pulvinar); 3T acceptable with optimized subcortical pipeline.
•	Network nodes: DMN (mPFC, PCC, hippocampus), SN (aINS, dACC).
•	Physiology: HRV, respiration.
•	Subjective: momentary distress, recovery time.
Procedure
1.	Baseline rest (5 min).
2.	Disruption Block A (cognitive) → Reentry.
3.	Disruption Block B (affective) → Reentry.
4.	Post scan recovery + debrief.
Primary Outcomes
•	Spectral DCM estimates: SN→DMN, thalamus→DMN per block; Δ(Reentry Disruption).
Secondary Outcomes
•	HRV restoration; subjective recovery latency; correlations with DCM changes.
Analysis Plan
•	First level GLMs; ROI extraction; spectral DCM across triad; within subject contrasts.
•	Mediation: Reentry effect on recovery mediated by thalamus→DMN normalization.
Power & N
•	Simulation based DCM power (pilot n≈12) to target Δ connectivity of medium size; planned N=48 after attrition.
Exclusions
•	Excess motion; inability to follow breath pacing; physiological data loss.
Prereg Items
•	ROI definitions; disruptor stimuli lists; DCM model space; breath cadence; primary contrasts; recovery metrics.
Ethics & Safety
•	Non traumatic disruptors; monitoring; immediate abort option.
Reentry Protocol
•	Paced breath after each disruptor; post scan guided grounding; follow up check if needed.
Data/Code
•	BIDS; DCM model space shared; prereg on OSF; analysis scripts public.

Notes for All Studies
•	Blinding: Analysts blinded to condition/group where feasible.
•	Multiple Comparisons: Limit to prereg ROIs; FDR for exploratory.
•	Reporting: Deviations from prereg documented; null results reported.
•	Generalization: Templates are modular—swap tasks for population specific variants (e.g., grief instead of trauma; dyadic tasks for Wₑ).

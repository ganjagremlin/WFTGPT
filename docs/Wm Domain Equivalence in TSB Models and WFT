Wₘ Domain Equivalence in Temporal–Spatial–Bio-Somatic Models and WFT
Section 1: Introductory Alignment
The paper Toward a Domain-Based Model of Memory (TSB) introduces a tripartite model of memory—temporal, spatial, and bio-somatic—grounded in functional neuroanatomy and framed as an alternative to classical declarative/non-declarative taxonomies. While empirically rigorous and neurofunctionally distinct, these domains converge with the recursive subfunction structure of Wₘ in Witness Field Theory (WFT). This Translator-Node establishes the recursive equivalence between TSB’s proposed domains and Wₘ’s triphasic modulation grammar: Wₘ:temporal, Wₘ:spatial, and Wₘ:bio-somatic.
To clarify this alignment, WFT’s witness function architecture must be introduced. In WFT, W(i,d) is the modulated interface by which identity metabolizes recursive force (Φ, λ, O). It is not perception or memory per se, but a layered modulation structure that scaffolds symbolic recursion. Witness types include:
•	Wₛ (symbolic): enables language, gesture, and communicable traces.
•	Wᵣ (reflective): metabolizes paradox, stabilizes narrative recursion.
•	Wₘ (memory/somatic): holds pre-verbal recursive residues, dream traces, and somatic signal arcs.
•	Wₑ (external/relational): modulates recursion through field mirroring and symbolic feedback.
Rather than interpret TSB through analogy, this Node metabolizes its structure by identifying its implicit force topologies, collapse gradients, and recursive residues. Where TSB speaks in systems neuroscience, WFT offers witness modulation and symbolic delay. The goal is not to map one model onto another but to expose their shared recursive pressure and clarify the position of TSB within the WFT Ξ_layer stack. This alignment enables TSB to serve as a Ξ_mid scaffold for deeper symbolic recursion without contamination by mimicry or inflation.

Section 2: Domain-to-Subfunction Mapping
TSB differentiates memory into three functional domains—temporal, spatial, and bio-somatic—each grounded in discrete neuroanatomical circuits. In WFT, these correspond structurally to recursive subfunctions of Wₘ, the witness function of memory. Each Wₘ mode emerges as a metabolization interface between recursion residue and symbolic integration. This section establishes equivalence not by analogy, but by force topology, phase delay, and witness signature.
2.1 Temporal Domain → Wₘ:temporal
TSB locates temporal memory in circuits such as the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), hippocampus, and anterior thalamic nuclei. These structures encode "when" information and episodic sequence, generating coherence across time. WFT names this function Wₘ:temporal—a recursive behavior that stabilizes phase-sequenced residue across cycles. It is not memory as storage, but as temporal compression: oscillatory trace folded into symbolically metabolizable arcs.
Wₘ:temporal modulates reentry by holding past recursion at delay—not as index, but as potential symbol. It enables reflective narration via Wᵣ, but exists independently. Collapse here produces narrative disjunction, time drift, or recursive lag (Ξ_t∆). In TSB, this appears in PTSD-like fragmentation or Alzheimer’s-related temporal flattening—structural phenomena recognizable in WFT as Wₘ:temporal degradation.
2.2 Spatial Domain → Wₘ:spatial
TSB’s spatial domain includes retrosplenial cortex, hippocampal map circuits, and the medial prefrontal cortex. It enables spatial anchoring of memory and integration with environmental context. WFT identifies this as Wₘ:spatial—the phase-tracing function that binds symbolic residues to contextual lattices, permitting coherent return to recursive sites. It allows identity not only to move through time, but to locate itself structurally within recursive environments.
Wₘ:spatial anchors symbolic recursion into Ξ_field conditions. Without it, identity floats—unable to lock reentry or metabolize symbolic drag. Collapse here appears in dissociation, spatial disorientation, and derealization syndromes. In TSB, this is recognized in Alzheimer’s spatial confusion and in context-loss trauma loops.
2.3 Bio-Somatic Domain → Wₘ:bio-somatic
TSB emphasizes a domain often marginalized in cognitive models: the somatic, interoceptive memory system mediated by insular and thalamic integration. In WFT, this is Wₘ:bio-somatic—the somatically stabilized memory trace. It does not pass through language but stabilizes recursion via gesture, rhythm, affect, and pre-symbolic pattern. It encodes collapse events and recursive scars as phase-locks within the body-field.
Wₘ:bio-somatic is vital in trauma metabolization, dream recursion, and symbolic action. It cannot be accessed by interpretation; only reentered through embodied recursion. Collapse here yields alexithymia, psychosomatic disjunction, and symbolic anesthesia. TSB’s bio-somatic domain captures these conditions in empirical terms but lacks witness modulation grammar.

Section 3: Collapse Topologies and Witness Gradient
While TSB does not explicitly reference collapse, its engagement with clinical pathologies—PTSD, Alzheimer’s, alexithymia—reveals implicit recursive degradation signatures. In WFT, collapse is not defined by dysfunction per se but by failure of witness modulation, symbolic metabolization, or force-phase alignment. This section surfaces the W(i,d) gradients embedded in TSB’s model and shows how their absence impedes recursive integrity.
3.1 PTSD: Wₘ Amplification without Wᵣ Coordination
TSB frames PTSD as persistent over-activation in temporal and somatic domains. In WFT terms, this reflects hyperfunctional Wₘ:temporal and Wₘ:bio-somatic activity without adequate Wᵣ modulation. Recursive residue accumulates without symbolic metabolization, producing feedback loops, flashbacks, and dissociative reentry failure. The symptom is not memory excess, but witness fragmentation—recursive traces uncoupled from symbolic interface.
Without Wᵣ (reflective witness), force metabolization cannot occur; the system loops, simulates, or ruptures. TSB names this in empirical terms (e.g., trauma persistence, interoceptive overload), but lacks the recursive topology needed for reentry design.
3.2 Alzheimer’s: Wₘ Core Collapse with Wₛ Shell Preservation
In Alzheimer’s progression, TSB highlights surface behavioral retention (ritualized routines, language fragments) amidst episodic and contextual memory loss. This maps to Ξ_surface persistence with Ξ_deep collapse—specifically, Wₘ:temporal and Wₘ:spatial disintegration with superficial Wₛ continuity. The recursive body remains symbolically animated but loses metabolization depth.
In WFT, this is a collapse into simulation: W(i,d) flickers, but lineage is severed. The system may display symbolic habits without recursive inheritance. TSB captures this behaviorally but cannot model its recursive logic without WFT’s layered witness architecture.
3.3 Alexithymia: Wₘ Flatlining and Wₑ Saturation
Alexithymia, as described in TSB, involves failure to recognize, symbolize, or narrate affective states. WFT frames this as Wₘ:bio-somatic under-modulation combined with Wₑ overmirror—symbolic loops formed externally, without internal metabolization. The system reflects symbolic cues from the field (Ξ_surface) without recursive trace activation. Collapse here is not absence of affect, but recursive numbness—metabolization void.
TSB notes insular deactivation and reduced interoceptive awareness, but without a witness grammar it cannot model recursive restoration or symbolic reentry. WFT provides the missing modulation scaffold to transition from mimicry to metabolization.
3.4 ADHD: Temporal Phase Drift and Wₘ:temporal Desynchronization
TSB alludes to executive timing deficits and working memory disruptions in ADHD. From a WFT perspective, these symptoms reflect Wₘ:temporal modulation instability—a failure to maintain recursive phase alignment over time. The system cannot reliably compress oscillatory fragments into metabolizable symbolic arcs, resulting in symbolic flicker, impulsivity, and recursive stutter.
This collapse is not purely cognitive—it is temporal. Ξ_field conditions become λ-skewed: displacement dominates over coherence. Symbolic structures initiate but fail to anchor, producing behavioral drift and time-blind recursion. TSB’s account of attentional instability correlates with this, but lacks the recursive force grammar (Φ/λ/O) to model system-wide reentry failure or design recovery scaffolds.
3.5 Autism: Wₑ Overmodulation and Wₘ:spatial-Rupture
Autism, in TSB, is discussed in terms of atypical interoception, spatial context-processing, and affect regulation. WFT identifies this topology as a complex modulation imbalance:
•	Wₑ saturation: heightened field mirroring, resulting in symbolic overwhelm or boundary blurring.
•	Wₘ:spatial irregularity: difficulty integrating recursive residues into context-stable patterns.
•	Possible Wᵣ amplification: hyperactive reflective recursion, especially in high-functioning systems, leading to paradox metabolization strain.
Autistic recursion often collapses under field conditions not because of symbolic incapacity, but because symbolic metabolization exceeds capacity. Ξ_field becomes Φ-intense without O-buffering, overloading recursive throughput. TSB notes social and sensory overload, but WFT clarifies the recursive structure: identity becomes phase-locked in local recursion with limited cross-symbolic transfer, generating “islands” of intense coherence amid general field mismatch.

Section 4: Force Clarification and Ξ_field Positioning
While TSB delivers a coherent neurofunctional map of memory systems, it does so without recursive force articulation. In WFT, all recursive behavior—stabilization, collapse, or transformation—arises from the interaction of three force types: coherence (Φ), displacement (λ), and oscillation (O). Memory domains, as described in TSB, cannot be metabolized into identity recursion until these forces are configured, and the surrounding Ξ_field conditions recognized.
4.1 Force Configuration in TSB Domains
•	The temporal domain is primarily Φ-oriented: sequencing, continuity, and temporal binding indicate coherence-driven recursion.
•	The spatial domain integrates Φ and λ: it stabilizes identity within shifting environments but collapses under displacement or desynchronization.
•	The bio-somatic domain introduces O-dominance: oscillatory encoding, rhythm memory, and interoceptive signal flicker suggest recursive flicker under paradox or symbolic overload.
TSB identifies behaviors associated with these domains but not their force interactions. Without this grammar, symbolic metabolization appears as feature variance rather than topological necessity.
4.2 Ξ_field Positioning of TSB
TSB operates as a Ξ_mid to Ξ_surface interface structure:
•	It models recursive behavior implicitly—through system dynamics, not through symbolic lineage.
•	It stabilizes partial recursive topology without symbol inflation.
•	It is susceptible to mimicry if its structural implications are applied without recursive metabolization.
As such, it cannot be used directly for Ξ_deep field intervention or collapse reentry design. But once metabolized via this Translator-Node, it becomes recursively coherent with WFT’s Wₘ architecture, and can seed Micro-Node development or Ξ_field diagnosis tools for clinical, cognitive, or synthetic systems.

Abstract:
Traditional models of memory categorize brain systems based on declarative vs. non-declarative processes, or episodic vs. semantic content (Squire, 2004; Tulving, 1983). While useful, these classifications often obscure the anatomical specificity and functional diversity of memory-related regions. We propose an alternative framework that organizes memory systems into three functional domains: temporal (when), spatial (where), and bio-somatic (how it felt). Each domain reflects a distinct dimension of experience and corresponds to partially dissociable but overlapping neural substrates.
Structures like the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) and medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) demonstrate domain-specific encoding of temporal and spatial information, respectively (Tsao et al., 2018; Hafting et al., 2005; Sugar & Moser, 2019). In contrast, regions such as the insula and amygdala are central to bio-somatic memory, encoding interoceptive and affective components of experience (Craig, 2002; Critchley et al., 2004; Damasio, 1996). The thalamus serves as an integrative relay, with subnuclei contributing to all three domains in context-dependent ways (Mitchell, 2015; Sherman, 2007).
This domain-based approach emphasizes functional gradients over strict categorical boundaries and offers a new lens through which to examine memory encoding, storage, and retrieval. It has particular relevance for understanding clinical conditions like PTSD, interoceptive disorders, and Alzheimer's disease, where disruption may preferentially affect one domain over others. We conclude by outlining how this framework can inform experimental design and guide interpretation of lesion, neuroimaging, and behavioral data.

1. Introduction
Memory is commonly understood through psychological or functional taxonomies—episodic versus semantic, declarative versus non-declarative, explicit versus implicit (Tulving, 1972; Squire & Zola, 1996; Baddeley, 2000). While these categories have shaped decades of experimental design and clinical theory, they tend to emphasize content and accessibility rather than the specific anatomical pathways through which different aspects of experience are encoded and stored. As a result, structures that play vital roles in memory—such as the insula, thalamus, or certain thalamic subnuclei—are often minimized or omitted from major frameworks, despite mounting evidence of their contributions (Craig, 2009; Sherman & Guillery, 2002; Kurth et al., 2010).
We argue that many gaps in current models can be addressed by adopting a domain-based organization of memory systems, grounded not in abstract categories of knowledge, but in the types of information the brain must represent to construct experience. These gaps have been noted in recent critiques of reductionist memory taxonomies (Eichenbaum, 2017; Moscovitch et al., 2016). 
We propose three core domains: temporal memory (the sequencing and ordering of events), spatial memory (location, orientation, and navigational context), and bio-somatic memory (the internal bodily and affective states experienced during an event). These domains are not exclusive, nor do they map one-to-one with classic memory types (Tulving, 1983; Squire & Zola, 1996). Rather, they represent distinct dimensions of lived experience, each supported by overlapping but functionally biased neural substrates.
This framework allows us to recontextualize structures such as the lateral and medial entorhinal cortices—long known for their role in temporal and spatial encoding, respectively (Tsao et al., 2018; Hafting et al., 2005)—and bring renewed attention to regions like the insula, which contributes centrally to bodily awareness and affective experience but is rarely discussed in memory literature (Craig, 2002; Kurth et al., 2010). It also provides a basis for understanding how hub structures like the thalamus participate across domains through their subregional specializations, rather than being assigned a single static role (Sherman & Guillery, 2002; Mitchell, 2015).
Importantly, this approach does not reject classical models of memory, but instead supplements them by offering a more anatomically and functionally precise mapping of how different types of information are processed. It encourages a shift away from viewing memory as a monolithic or single-system function and toward a model in which multiple interacting subsystems emphasize different types of memory content based on behavioral and physiological relevance.
In the sections that follow, we define each of the three proposed domains and map their associated brain structures using evidence from neuroanatomy, lesion studies, electrophysiology, and functional imaging (Eichenbaum, 2013; Critchley et al., 2004). We then explore how these domains interact in both healthy cognition and clinical conditions, including PTSD, dementia, and interoceptive disorders. Finally, we propose a research agenda for testing and refining this framework, with implications for both experimental neuroscience and translational neuropsychology.

2. The Temporal–Spatial–Bio-Somatic Memory Framework
The proposed framework reorganizes memory systems around three functional domains, each corresponding to a core dimension of experience: time, space, and bodily state. While traditional models have prioritized distinctions like declarative versus procedural or episodic versus semantic, those categories often lack anatomical specificity and underemphasize the diversity of neural mechanisms supporting memory formation. Our approach instead begins with the types of information encoded, which are more closely tied to ecological function and cortical-subcortical architecture.
We define the three domains below and outline how each serves distinct behavioral and cognitive functions, supported by partially separable neural circuits.
2.1 Temporal Memory
Temporal memory refers to the brain’s capacity to track the order, duration, and flow of events. This includes both explicit representations of sequence (“what happened before what?”) and more implicit temporal scaffolding that supports the structure of episodic recall (Howard & Eichenbaum, 2013; Ranganath & Hsieh, 2016). It is fundamental to forming narratives, anticipating outcomes, and distinguishing past from present.
Neuroanatomically, temporal memory relies heavily on the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC), hippocampal subfields (especially CA1), and the medial prefrontal cortex (Tsao et al., 2018; Howard & Eichenbaum, 2013; Eichenbaum, 2017). These regions support temporal context binding and event sequencing, often in collaboration with the thalamus (particularly the nucleus reuniens and mediodorsal nucleus) to synchronize hippocampal–prefrontal interactions (Vertes, 2006; Mitchell, 2015; Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019).
Temporal memory can be seen as the brain’s attempt to chronologize experience, creating order out of continuous input (Ranganath & Hsieh, 2016; Howard et al., 2014). It is essential for episodic memory but also informs planning, working memory, and even aspects of affective forecasting (Addis et al., 2007; Schacter et al., 2012).
2.2 Spatial Memory
Spatial memory supports our understanding of location, direction, and navigational context. It allows us to orient ourselves, recall the layout of environments, and encode where events occurred. Spatial encoding is not limited to physical movement—it includes imagined spaces and mental mapping of relational structures (Burgess et al., 2002; Eichenbaum, 2014).
The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is central to spatial memory, housing grid cells that provide a coordinate system for movement through space (Hafting et al., 2005; Moser & Moser in Tsao et al., 2018). These inputs project to hippocampal place cells, particularly in CA3 and the dentate gyrus, which encode location-specific representations (O’Keefe & Nadel, cited in Burgess et al., 2002). Additional spatial contributions arise from the posterior parietal cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and anterior thalamic nuclei, the latter of which is part of the Papez circuit and supports spatial contextualization (Aggleton & Brown, 1999; Taube, 2007).
Spatial memory serves both short-term behaviors (navigation, orientation) and long-term episodic reconstruction (“where was I when that happened?”) (Eichenbaum, 2014). Its circuitry is tightly conserved across species and has been a cornerstone of systems neuroscience (Moser et al., 2008; Hafting et al., 2005).
2.3 Bio-Somatic Memory
Bio-somatic memory refers to the encoding of internal bodily states, visceral sensations, and affective experiences that accompany an event. It encompasses both the interoceptive dimension of memory (e.g., sensing one’s heartbeat, gut feeling, or muscle tension) and the emotional coloring of events, particularly those with survival relevance.
This domain is centered anatomically in the insula, especially the anterior insular cortex, which integrates interoceptive signals with conscious awareness and emotional salience (Craig, 2009; Critchley & Harrison, 2013; Berntson & Khalsa, 2021). The amygdala also plays a central role, assigning emotional value and supporting affective conditioning (e.g., fear memory) (LeDoux, 2000). The posterior insula, somatosensory cortex, and parts of the anterior cingulate cortex contribute to the bodily “texture” of recalled experience (Craig, 2002; Seeley et al., 2007). Subcortical contributions come from the hypothalamus, brainstem autonomic centers, and thalamic nuclei (e.g., VPL/VPM, pulvinar, MD), which relay somatic and visceral information to the cortex (Saalmann & Kastner, 2011).
Bio-somatic memory is especially relevant in emotionally intense or traumatic events. It underlies the phenomenon of somatic flashbacks and contributes to persistent bodily states seen in conditions such as PTSD, chronic pain, or addiction (Brewin, 2011; Naqvi et al., 2007). While less represented in classical memory models, it is increasingly recognized as essential for the subjective realism and intensity of recall (Damasio, 1996).
2.4 Non-Exclusive, Interacting Domains
While these three domains are presented separately for clarity, in practice they are deeply interactive. Most real-life memories contain elements of all three: we remember when something occurred, where it happened, and how we felt. What differs is the relative contribution and neural emphasis based on the context, task, or individual.
For example:
•	A person with medial temporal lobe damage may lose spatial memory but retain emotional reactions.
•	A trauma survivor may recall intense bodily sensations with minimal spatial or temporal anchoring.
•	A navigation task may demand primarily spatial encoding, but emotional or bodily markers can enhance or interfere with recall.
This underscores the value of a domain-based framework: it allows for graded participation of brain regions, accommodates cross-domain interactions, and offers a way to explain the diversity of memory impairments and enhancements observed in both healthy and clinical populations.

3. Neuroanatomical Mapping of Memory Domains
Each of the three proposed memory domains—temporal, spatial, and bio-somatic—is supported by a network of neural structures with distinct anatomical specializations. Some regions show domain-specific encoding properties, while others serve as integrative hubs that participate in multiple domains depending on context. This section outlines the primary and secondary contributors to each domain, with emphasis on structure–function specificity and the ways in which anatomical features support domain-relevant computations.
3.1 Temporal Memory Structures
The lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) plays a central role in temporal memory. It receives polymodal inputs from the perirhinal cortex, including object and context information, and projects heavily to CA1 of the hippocampus. Functional studies demonstrate that LEC activity encodes the sequential order of stimuli, the duration between events, and the temporal context of experience (Tsao et al., 2018; Suh et al., 2011; Kanter et al., 2025). Inactivation of LEC impairs rodents' ability to recall event order or recognize familiar stimuli in the correct sequence (Suh et al., 2011).
The hippocampus, particularly CA1, serves as a convergence point for temporal signals from LEC and other cortical inputs. CA1 neurons can represent elapsed time over short intervals and exhibit time cell activity, making it critical for constructing temporal narratives (Howard & Eichenbaum, 2013; Howard et al., 2014; Eichenbaum, 2014).
The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) also participates in temporal processing, especially during tasks involving temporal prediction, context updating, or goal-related sequencing. The thalamic nucleus reuniens plays a key role in synchronizing hippocampal–prefrontal interactions, acting as a temporal coordination hub (Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019; Vertes, 2006; Mitchell, 2015).
Together, these regions form a distributed temporal system that enables the brain to reconstruct when events occurred, how long they lasted, and in what order they unfolded.
3.2 Spatial Memory Structures
Spatial memory is most clearly associated with the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC), which houses grid cells—neurons that fire in a regular spatial pattern across the environment, forming an internal coordinate system (Hafting et al., 2005). MEC receives input from postrhinal and retrosplenial cortices, which are involved in visual and contextual spatial encoding (Burgess et al., 2002; Taube, 2007).
Grid cells in MEC project to hippocampal place cells, especially in CA3 and the dentate gyrus, which fire in specific locations and help construct detailed spatial maps (Burgess et al., 2002). These circuits are supported by the anterior thalamic nuclei (ATN), which connect the hippocampus to the cingulate and retrosplenial cortices via the Papez circuit. Damage to the ATN or its connections leads to profound spatial disorientation and impaired contextual memory (Aggleton & Brown, 1999).
Additional contributors include the posterior parietal cortex, involved in egocentric spatial coding, and the superior colliculus, which contributes to orienting and spatial attention (Taube, 2007). Spatial processing also engages the subiculum, which routes hippocampal output to navigation-related targets.
Overall, spatial memory depends on a well-characterized and evolutionarily conserved set of regions that support both egocentric and allocentric spatial representations, route planning, and environmental mapping.
3.3 Bio-Somatic Memory Structures
Bio-somatic memory involves encoding the visceral, affective, and interoceptive aspects of experience. Central to this system is the insula, especially the anterior insula, which integrates interoceptive signals from the body (e.g., heart rate, respiration, gastrointestinal sensations) and represents them at the level of conscious awareness (Craig, 2009; Critchley & Harrison, 2013; Berntson & Khalsa, 2021). The anterior insula is also involved in emotional feeling states such as anxiety, disgust, or craving—experiences often tightly bound to memory (Craig, 2009).
The posterior insula contributes more directly to somatosensory integration, including pain, temperature, and touch, particularly during high-intensity or aversive experiences (Craig, 2002). These sensory signals are relayed from the thalamus, especially the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) and ventral posterior medial (VPM) nuclei (Saalmann & Kastner, 2011).
The amygdala is a core structure for emotional salience and affective conditioning, particularly in relation to fear, reward, and threat. It interacts closely with both the insula and hypothalamus, enabling rapid somatic responses to emotionally charged stimuli. The central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) is especially involved in autonomic and behavioral output (LeDoux, 2000).
The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) contributes to bodily-based affective experience, integrating pain, conflict, and motivational salience (Seeley et al., 2007). The periaqueductal gray (PAG) and brainstem autonomic centers complete this network by modulating the physiological expression of recalled bodily states (Critchley & Harrison, 2013).
Bio-somatic memory is often underrepresented in conventional memory models, but it is essential to understanding conditions where memory is experienced as felt rather than narrated—such as trauma flashbacks, pain memory, or craving.
3.4 Multi-Domain Structures and Integration
Some brain regions are not confined to a single domain, but participate flexibly across contexts. The thalamus is a prime example. Its various nuclei serve different functions: the anterior nuclei support spatial memory, the mediodorsal and reuniens nuclei contribute to temporal processing, and the pulvinar and VPL/VPM participate in bio-somatic and multisensory integration (Mitchell, 2015; Saalmann & Kastner, 2011; Aggleton & Brown, 1999). Rather than specializing in memory per se, the thalamus supports coordination and communication between specialized systems.
The hippocampus also integrates across domains. While it has been traditionally associated with episodic memory, it receives domain-specific inputs from LEC (temporal) and MEC (spatial), and it participates in emotionally salient memory encoding through interactions with the amygdala (Eichenbaum, 2014). The hippocampus may serve as a convergence hub where temporal, spatial, and bio-somatic features are bound into unified episodes (Howard et al., 2014).
Similarly, the default mode network (DMN)—including the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and angular gyrus—supports the reconstruction of memory across domains. Although not tied to a specific sensory input, the DMN enables mental simulation, autobiographical narrative, and integration of time, place, and emotion (Northoff & Bermpohl, 2004).
This neuroanatomical mapping offers a structured approach to understanding how distinct types of information are supported by partially overlapping brain systems. In the next section, we explore how these systems interact dynamically during memory formation and retrieval, and how their balance may shift based on task demands or pathological conditions.

4. Domain Interaction and Dynamic Modulation
Although the temporal, spatial, and bio-somatic domains of memory are anatomically and functionally dissociable, they rarely operate in isolation. Real-world memory processes involve the integration of multiple domains, often with shifting dominance depending on context, attentional focus, affective state, and cognitive load. This section outlines how these domains interact, compensate, and modulate one another in dynamic and behaviorally relevant ways.
4.1 Real-World Memory as Multi-Domain
In most everyday experiences, memory is not confined to a single dimension. Recalling a childhood event, for instance, typically involves where it happened (spatial), when it occurred in relation to other events (temporal), and how it felt physically or emotionally (bio-somatic). These features are interdependent: spatial context can aid temporal sequencing; bodily sensations may serve as anchors for autobiographical retrieval; and temporal cues can help organize emotional memories into coherent narratives (Addis et al., 2007; Schacter et al., 2017).
This interdependence is reflected in neural co-activation patterns. Functional imaging studies frequently show co-activation of hippocampus, insula, prefrontal cortex, and default mode network regions during memory retrieval (Eichenbaum, 2017; Seeley et al., 2007). Such distributed patterns suggest that domain-specific structures operate in concert, contributing different facets of the remembered experience.
4.2 Task-Dependent Modulation of Domain Emphasis
The relative contribution of each domain varies depending on the demands of the task or the nature of the experience. For example:
•	Navigation tasks (e.g., route planning or spatial recall) primarily engage the spatial domain, activating the MEC, hippocampus, retrosplenial cortex, and anterior thalamus. However, emotionally salient environments may also activate the amygdala and insula, layering bio-somatic features onto spatial memory (Hafting et al., 2005; Aggleton & Brown, 1999; Taube, 2007).
•	Narrative recall or episodic sequencing tasks rely heavily on temporal processing, activating the LEC, CA1, medial prefrontal cortex, and associated thalamic relays. Yet when the narrative contains emotionally charged or embodied elements, the insula and amygdala are recruited as well (Tsao et al., 2018; Howard & Eichenbaum, 2013; Vertes, 2006).
•	Traumatic memory retrieval often shows a bio-somatic dominance, particularly in PTSD. In such cases, individuals may vividly re-experience bodily sensations or emotional states with only fragmented or absent spatial and temporal context (Brewin, 2011; Naqvi et al., 2007). This “domain imbalance” may reflect hyperactivation of the insula and amygdala, with reduced engagement of hippocampal or cortical temporal-spatial systems (Critchley & Harrison, 2013; Seeley et al., 2007).
This kind of domain-specific modulation suggests that the brain flexibly reweights domain systems depending on internal priorities (e.g., survival relevance, affective salience) or external task goals.
4.3 Compensation and Interaction in Dysfunction
When one domain is impaired—due to injury, disease, or neurodevelopmental variation—others may compensate. For example:
•	Patients with hippocampal damage may show impaired temporal and spatial memory but retain emotionally vivid, bodily-anchored memories. These may be mediated through insula–amygdala circuits, allowing bio-somatic features to “carry” the memory in absence of contextual detail (Addis et al., 2007; Eichenbaum, 2013; Craig, 2009).
•	In contrast, insula lesions can diminish the felt sense of emotional or interoceptive recall while leaving spatial and temporal memory intact. Such patients may recall facts and timelines but describe them as emotionally “flat” or disembodied (Naqvi et al., 2007; Critchley & Harrison, 2013).
•	In Alzheimer’s disease, early hippocampal degeneration disrupts both temporal and spatial memory, while bio-somatic elements may persist longer—possibly contributing to emotional reactivity in the absence of full episodic recall (Eichenbaum, 2014; Berntson & Khalsa, 2021).
These patterns emphasize the value of recognizing domain-specific vulnerabilities in clinical conditions. The proposed framework may aid in identifying which aspects of memory are degraded or preserved, with implications for diagnosis and intervention.
4.4 Cross-Domain Anchoring and Reinforcement
Domains can also mutually reinforce one another. Spatial or bio-somatic anchors often improve temporal recall, and vice versa (Schacter et al., 2017; Addis et al., 2007). For instance:
•	Embedding a memory in a vivid spatial context (e.g., remembering the layout of a room) can enhance recall of when events occurred (Brewin, 2011; LeDoux, 2000).
•	Recalling the bodily or emotional state during an experience can retrieve otherwise inaccessible spatial or temporal details, a phenomenon commonly reported in trauma therapy or affect-laden autobiographical memory (Critchley et al., 2004).
•	Rehearsal and narrative construction—especially in social or therapeutic contexts—can transform isolated domain fragments into integrated, stable episodes (Addis et al., 2007; Schacter et al., 2017).
Such cross-domain effects reflect both bottom-up sensory integration and top-down narrative reconstruction, coordinated by prefrontal–hippocampal–thalamo-cortical circuits (Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019; Vertes, 2006).
4.5 A Flexible, Graded Model of Memory Systems
Rather than assigning brain regions to fixed memory “types,” this framework encourages a view of memory as a graded, dynamic system. Brain structures may have domain biases, but they are also context-sensitive, capable of shifting functions under different internal or external conditions.
This perspective aligns with recent trends in systems neuroscience that emphasize:
•	Dynamic functional connectivity over static modularity
•	Task-specific recruitment of large-scale networks
•	Affective, bodily, and environmental influences on memory processing
(Eichenbaum, 2017; Northoff & Bermpohl, 2004; Seeley et al., 2007; Berntson & Khalsa, 2021)
It also accommodates findings from lesion studies, intracranial stimulation, and neuroimaging that reveal complex, distributed patterns of memory-related activity inconsistent with strict category-based models (Moscovitch et al., 2016; Eichenbaum, 2013).
By recognizing the fluid boundaries and interactivity of memory domains, we move closer to a framework that accounts for the richness of real-world cognition. In the next section, we explore how this model maps onto specific clinical conditions, and how it may inform future experimental and translational research.

5. Clinical and Experimental Implications
The temporal–spatial–bio-somatic framework offers a new lens through which to understand memory dysfunction in clinical populations and to design experiments that better isolate and test memory subdomains. Traditional diagnostic categories often emphasize “memory loss” or “cognitive decline” in generalized terms, but patients rarely lose all dimensions of memory equally. Instead, deficits often emerge selectively in one or two domains, while others remain relatively preserved or even intensified. Below we outline several conditions where domain-specific vulnerabilities are evident, and suggest ways this model can inform both clinical interpretation and research design.
5.1 PTSD and Trauma-Related Disorders: Bio-Somatic Dominance, Temporal-Spatial Fragmentation
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) presents a vivid example of memory imbalance. Traumatic memories are often characterized by intense bodily and emotional reliving, while lacking clear temporal and spatial context (Brewin, 2011). Patients report flashbacks that feel immediate, physically embodied, and emotionally overwhelming, yet disconnected from chronological order or location.
This profile suggests hyperactivation of bio-somatic circuits—notably the insula, amygdala, anterior cingulate, and periaqueductal gray—alongside impaired hippocampal-prefrontal connectivity involved in temporal and spatial binding (Critchley & Harrison, 2013; Craig, 2009; Seeley et al., 2007; Vertes, 2006). Functional imaging studies confirm this pattern, showing heightened activity in the anterior insula and amygdala during trauma recall, with diminished activation in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (Brewin, 2011; Critchley et al., 2004).
The proposed framework helps explain why treatments that reintegrate fragmented domains—such as narrative-based exposure therapy, EMDR, or somatic therapies—can be effective (Schacter et al., 2017). These methods work not by erasing the memory, but by restoring temporal and spatial anchors to a dominantly bio-somatic trace.
5.2 Alzheimer’s Disease and Dementia: Temporal-Spatial Degradation, Bio-Somatic Residuals
In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), one of the earliest and most prominent deficits is the loss of temporal and spatial orientation (Eichenbaum, 2013; Eichenbaum, 2014). Patients struggle to recall when events occurred, navigate familiar environments, or retain contextual information. These symptoms align with early degeneration of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and retrosplenial areas, which are central to the temporal and spatial domains (Aggleton & Brown, 1999).
Interestingly, bio-somatic memory features—particularly emotional reactivity and embodied recall—can persist even as spatial and temporal coherence deteriorate (Craig, 2009; Berntson & Khalsa, 2021). Patients may recognize a familiar song or photograph not by factual memory, but by visceral feeling (Damasio, 1996). Such preserved affective responses may be mediated by relatively spared structures like the insula and amygdala during earlier disease stages.
The domain-based model allows clinicians to differentiate between episodic disintegration and emotional memory preservation, and offers support for therapies that engage somatic and emotional circuits (e.g., music therapy, sensory integration) even in the absence of cognitive clarity.
5.3 Interoceptive Disorders and Alexithymia: Bio-Somatic Deficits
Conditions involving disconnection from bodily sensation—such as alexithymia, certain forms of depersonalization, or interoceptive disorders in autism and functional somatic syndromes—can be reframed as impairments in the bio-somatic domain (Berntson & Khalsa, 2021).
These patients often retain accurate spatial and temporal memory but struggle to describe or even detect how they felt in a given moment (Critchley & Harrison, 2013). Neuroimaging and lesion studies implicate dysfunction in the anterior insula, posterior insula, and somatosensory integration networks (Craig, 2002; Craig, 2009). The absence or distortion of bio-somatic anchoring may lead to flattened emotional recall, reduced empathy, or difficulty constructing personally meaningful narratives (Damasio, 1996).
This framework encourages targeted assessments and interventions aimed at restoring interoceptive awareness, such as body-based psychotherapy, mindfulness training, or neurofeedback directed at insular circuits.
5.4 Addiction and Craving: Dysregulated Bio-Somatic Encoding
Addiction is also influenced by bio-somatic memory dynamics. Craving is not purely cognitive—it is embodied and often triggered by interoceptive cues (e.g., withdrawal sensations, visceral urges) (Naqvi et al., 2007). Structures like the insula and amygdala encode and retrieve these states, linking them to environmental cues via associative learning (LeDoux, 2000; Craig, 2009).
Damage to the insula has been shown to disrupt the ability to experience craving altogether, as famously demonstrated in stroke patients who spontaneously quit smoking after insular lesions (Naqvi et al., 2007). This supports the idea that addiction may involve maladaptive bio-somatic memory circuits, with cravings representing a form of persistent, involuntary bodily memory.
Understanding addiction through this lens suggests that effective treatment may require modulating bio-somatic memory, not just reducing exposure to cues. Somatic therapies, interoceptive retraining, and neuromodulation of insular networks (e.g., TMS or tDCS) may hold promise.
5.5 Experimental Applications and Research Design
This framework also opens new possibilities for experimental neuroscience:
•	Domain-Specific Tasks: Memory paradigms can be designed to isolate and test temporal, spatial, and bio-somatic components individually or in combination. For example, a study might compare:
o	Event sequence recall (temporal)
o	Virtual navigation (spatial)
o	Emotional-state matching or heartbeat detection during memory retrieval (bio-somatic)
(Howard et al., 2014; Addis et al., 2007)
•	fMRI and Lesion Studies: Brain imaging and lesion mapping can be analyzed through the lens of domain involvement rather than generic “memory performance,” potentially revealing more precise structure-function relationships.
(Moscovitch et al., 2016; Dolleman-van der Weel et al., 2019)
•	Cross-Domain Priming: Tasks can test how strengthening one domain (e.g., spatial context) influences retrieval in another (e.g., emotional or temporal recall), providing empirical support for domain interaction effects.
(Schacter et al., 2017)
•	Clinical Screening: Brief behavioral assessments could be tailored to profile patients’ domain strengths and vulnerabilities, potentially aiding differential diagnosis or therapy planning.
(Brewin, 2011)
The value of this model lies not just in its theoretical clarity, but in its functional utility: it guides researchers and clinicians toward more anatomically grounded, domain-specific interpretations of memory phenomena. By recognizing that memory is not a singular function but a composite of interacting systems, we are better equipped to explain—and ultimately influence—how memory fails, recovers, or transforms.
Next, we’ll conclude by summarizing the contributions of this framework and outlining key directions for future research.

6. Conclusion and Future Directions
This paper has proposed a domain-based model of memory organized around three fundamental dimensions of experience: temporal, spatial, and bio-somatic. Rather than classifying memory based solely on consciousness, intentionality, or task type—as in declarative vs. non-declarative or episodic vs. semantic frameworks—this model begins with the question: What kind of information is being encoded and retrieved, and how is it structured in the brain? (Tulving, 1972; Squire & Zola, 1996; Moscovitch et al., 2016)
By aligning memory function with the demands of tracking time, navigating space, and registering bodily/emotional states, this framework provides a clearer mapping onto neuroanatomical circuits. Structures such as the LEC and MEC, insula, amygdala, thalamus, and hippocampus can be meaningfully interpreted in terms of domain emphasis, allowing for both specificity and flexibility in understanding memory-related brain activity. (Tsao et al., 2018; Craig, 2002; Aggleton & Brown, 1999; Mitchell, 2015)
Crucially, the model is not meant to replace classical taxonomies but to complement them. It offers a different axis of analysis—one that accounts for the non-exclusive, interacting nature of memory systems and supports a graded, dynamic view of cognitive architecture (Moscovitch et al., 2016). In doing so, it opens new explanatory ground for a range of clinical presentations that are not well captured by current models (Brewin, 2011; Berntson & Khalsa, 2021).
6.1 Summary of Contributions
This framework provides several key advances:
1.	Domain Differentiation: It identifies three meaningful, experientially grounded domains of memory that correspond to partially dissociable brain systems.
2.	Anatomical Alignment: It enables clearer mapping between brain structures and memory functions, particularly for regions that are underrepresented in classical models (e.g., insula, pulvinar, anterior thalamus).
3.	Clinical Utility: It offers explanatory power for understanding selective impairments or enhancements of memory across diverse conditions, including PTSD, Alzheimer’s disease, interoceptive disorders, and addiction.
4.	Experimental Precision: It encourages the design of memory paradigms that isolate or combine specific domains, supporting more targeted neuroimaging, lesion analysis, and behavioral assessment.
5.	Integration over Isolation: It emphasizes interaction, compensation, and dynamic modulation among domains, aligning with current views of distributed and context-sensitive brain function.
6.2 Future Research Directions
Several concrete research paths emerge from this framework:
•	Domain-Specific Lesion Mapping: Systematically assess how focal damage to structures like the insula, thalamus, or entorhinal cortex affects memory within each domain (Naqvi et al., 2007; Mitchell, 2015; Suh et al., 2011).
•	Multimodal Imaging Studies: Use fMRI, MEG, and intracranial EEG to study domain co-activation and shifting dominance during different memory tasks (Moscovitch et al., 2016; Seeley et al., 2007).
•	Experimental Manipulations: Develop tasks that selectively tax temporal, spatial, or bio-somatic memory (e.g., interoceptive recall under uncertainty), and measure cross-domain effects (Schacter et al., 2017; Critchley & Harrison, 2013).
•	Cross-Domain Rehabilitation: Explore whether training or strengthening one domain (e.g., spatial context) can restore function in another (e.g., temporal coherence) in clinical populations (Addis et al., 2007).
•	Neurophenotyping: Use this model to classify patients not by global memory performance but by domain profile, potentially improving diagnostic resolution and personalized interventions (Brewin, 2011; Berntson & Khalsa, 2021).
6.3 Broader Implications
At its core, this framework invites a shift in how we conceptualize memory—not as a unitary process, but as a multi-dimensional synthesis of time, space, and bodily experience. Such a view better reflects how memory functions in naturalistic settings and how it breaks down in real-world conditions. It also allows neuroscience to speak more directly to subjective, embodied experience—something traditional cognitive models often underemphasize.
By bridging the gap between brain anatomy, experiential content, and clinical presentation, the temporal–spatial–bio-somatic model contributes to a more integrative and functionally grounded neuroscience of memory.
With this foundation in place, future work can refine, challenge, and extend the model. As experimental tools grow more precise and clinical data more granular, the ability to map memory not just by how we remember—but by what kind of information we are remembering—will be increasingly important.

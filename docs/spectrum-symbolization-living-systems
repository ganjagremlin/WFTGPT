A Spectrum of Symbolization in Living Systems
1. Introduction
Communication in living systems has traditionally been studied in fragmented domains: the alarm calls of primates, the dances of bees, the pheromone trails of ants, or the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) released by plants under stress. Each of these cases is well described within its own field — ethology, chemical ecology, plant sciences, or behavioral biology. Yet what is often missing is a unified framework that situates these diverse phenomena along a common conceptual axis.
In classical ethology, signals are defined as traits shaped by natural selection because they influence the behavior of others to the benefit of the signaler (Maynard Smith & Harper, 2003). More recently, fields such as biosemiotics (Hoffmeyer, 2008; Kull, 1999; Sebeok, 2001) have argued that all life is inherently semiotic, engaging in processes of sign-making and sign-interpretation. Likewise, niche construction theory (Odling-Smee et al., 2003) and Dawkins’ notion of the extended phenotype (Dawkins, 1982) emphasize how organisms externalize themselves into the environment in enduring ways. These lines of inquiry suggest that communication in the broad sense — the externalization of internal states or environmental knowledge — is both universal and central to life.
This paper proposes a new synthesis by reframing animal and plant communication in terms of symbolization, not in the linguistic or human sense, but in a biological sense:
Symbolization is the externalization of internal state or environmental knowledge into a perceivable form that influences the behavior of others.
Using this definition, we argue that communication across life can be understood as occurring on a spectrum with three primary forms:
1.	Biological / automatic symbolization — involuntary, always-on externalizations such as aposematic coloration or plant VOC release.
2.	Voluntary / selective symbolization — context-sensitive signals such as barks, alarm calls, or bee dances.
3.	Persistent / stored symbolization — externalized signals that persist in the environment, such as pheromone trails, territorial scent marking, or the extended structures built by animals, with human writing as the most elaborated case.
This tripartite framework offers a way to compare communication across plants, insects, mammals, and humans, highlighting both continuity and qualitative differences. It aims to bridge empirical biology with semiotics and philosophy of communication, while situating human symbolic culture as an extension — rather than an exception — within the broader living continuum.

2. Defining Symbolization
In both classical ethology and modern communication studies, signals are usually defined in functional terms: a signal is any trait shaped by natural selection because it modifies the behavior of receivers in ways beneficial to the sender, while a cue is a feature that provides information to others but was not shaped for that purpose (Maynard Smith & Harper, 2003). For example, the raised hackles of a frightened dog might be interpreted as a cue — an involuntary physiological response that reveals arousal — whereas the alarm call of a vervet monkey is a signal, evolved to influence group behavior (Seyfarth, Cheney, & Marler, 1980).
While this distinction is valuable, it risks fragmenting the broader phenomenon we are interested in here: the way living beings externalize hidden inner states or environmental knowledge into perceivable forms. This act of externalization, regardless of whether it is an evolved signal or an incidental cue, can be treated as a form of symbolization.
We therefore propose the following working definition:
Symbolization is the externalization of internal state or environmental knowledge into a perceivable form that influences the behavior of others.
This definition is intentionally broad. It is not restricted to intentional communication (as in human language), nor to adaptive signals in the strict ethological sense. It encompasses involuntary physiological expressions, evolved static traits such as aposematic coloration, context-sensitive vocalizations, and persistent modifications to the environment.
This framing also resonates with semiotic theory. Charles Sanders Peirce distinguished among indices (signs physically connected to what they represent), icons (signs that resemble their referents), and symbols (signs based on arbitrary convention). Biological communication often blurs these boundaries: a raised hackle is indexical of arousal; the waggle dance is iconic of distance and direction; aposematic coloration functions symbolically to predators by convention of evolved learning. In adopting the term symbolization in a biological sense, we aim not to collapse these categories but to emphasize their continuity as externalized signs in living systems.
In this sense, symbolization is not exclusive to humans, nor is it synonymous with linguistic symbolism. Instead, it is a biological universal, manifesting in different forms across taxa and ecological contexts.

3. Biological / Automatic Symbolization
The first form of symbolization in our framework is biological or automatic. These are signals that externalize internal states or properties without the sender’s voluntary control. They are often produced as part of metabolic, physiological, or morphological processes, yet they nonetheless function communicatively because they influence the behavior of other organisms.
3.1 Plants: Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and Floral Displays
Plants offer some of the clearest examples of automatic symbolization. When attacked by herbivores, many species release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air, which can serve multiple communicative functions: warning neighboring plants to activate chemical defenses, or attracting predatory insects that feed on the herbivores (Karban et al., 2014). These VOCs are not “chosen” but are biochemical responses that make the plant’s inner state of stress perceivable to others.
Similarly, flowers externalize reproductive state through color changes and scent emissions. These signals broadcast fertility or readiness for pollination to insect and bird pollinators (Raguso, 2008). The internal condition — reproductive maturity — is thus symbolized externally in a way that reliably shapes the behavior of others.
3.2 Insects: Aposematism and Mimicry
Many insects exhibit aposematic coloration: bright, contrasting patterns that advertise toxicity or unpalatability. Poison dart frogs, monarch butterflies, and wasps all use this form of symbolization (Ruxton et al., 2004). Here, the internal property of toxicity is externalized through a stable visual trait that predators learn to interpret.
A related case is Batesian mimicry, in which non-toxic species evolve to copy the coloration of toxic ones. Although the mimics lack the internal state of toxicity, they leverage the established symbolic system — bright coloring = danger — to influence predator behavior.
3.3 Mammals: Physiological Displays
Automatic symbolization is also found in animals with more flexible nervous systems. In mammals, many physiological responses produce involuntary signals:
•	Piloerection (raised hackles) in dogs and cats externalizes an internal state of arousal or fear.
•	Blushing in humans communicates embarrassment or stress (Darwin, 1872/1998).
•	Pupil dilation can signal heightened attention or arousal.
Although these responses are not voluntary, they still act as communicative symbols by influencing how others respond.
3.4 Interpretation
Biological symbolization is the base layer of communicative life. It represents evolution’s way of embedding signals into physiology and morphology, ensuring that certain inner states or properties are always visible to others. These signals are reliable precisely because they are automatic. They lack voluntary control, but they still fulfill the basic function of symbolization: externalizing what is otherwise hidden.

4. Voluntary / Selective Symbolization
If biological symbolization represents the “always-on” layer of communication, the next level is voluntary or selective symbolization. Here, organisms externalize their inner state or environmental knowledge only in certain contexts, choosing when and how to produce a symbol. This form is especially common among social animals, where flexible communication can be adaptive in coordinating behavior.
4.1 Dogs: Barking as Contextual Expression
Domestic dogs are an excellent example of voluntary symbolization. Unlike wolves, which vocalize relatively rarely, dogs bark in a variety of contexts shaped by both domestication and individual learning. Research shows that different bark patterns correspond to different contexts:
•	Alarm barks when a stranger approaches a territory.
•	Play barks during social interaction.
•	Separation barks when isolated (Yin & McCowan, 2004).
Dogs often deploy barking strategically, especially in interaction with humans, to demand attention, request resources, or signal alertness (Pongrácz et al., 2005). Here, barking is not a constant externalization but a selective symbolization, revealing internal states or environmental knowledge only when relevant.
4.2 Birds: Songs and Alarm Calls
Birds exemplify both the complexity and selectivity of voluntary symbolization.
•	Songs are used in mate attraction and territorial defense, often varying by season and context. They externalize reproductive state and territorial claims.
•	Alarm calls are highly context-specific; for instance, chickadees give different calls depending on the size and type of predator (Templeton et al., 2005).
In both cases, vocalizations are selectively produced to manage social and ecological situations.
4.3 Primates: Facial Expressions and Food Calls
Among primates, communication often blends vocal and visual modalities.
•	Facial expressions such as the “play face” or the “fear grimace” externalize affective states to regulate social interaction (de Waal, 2003).
•	Food calls in chimpanzees and other primates announce food discovery, externalizing environmental knowledge while also signaling willingness (or reluctance) to share (Slocombe & Zuberbühler, 2005).
These cases highlight that primates are capable of flexible, context-sensitive communication, bordering on intentional signaling.
4.4 Insects: The Waggle Dance of Bees
Not all voluntary symbolization requires a large brain. Honeybees perform the waggle dance, a ritualized behavior that encodes distance and direction to food sources relative to the sun (von Frisch, 1967). Foragers dance only when food is found, and only under conditions where the information will benefit the hive. This is an externalization of environmental knowledge that is highly selective, not constant.
4.5 Interpretation
Voluntary symbolization represents a significant step beyond biological symbolization. Instead of automatic physiological cues, organisms selectively externalize their states or perceptions depending on context. These symbols are flexible, situational, and often intentional, enabling more nuanced coordination within groups. They still lack the abstraction of human language, but they demonstrate the capacity for choice in symbol production.

5. Persistent / Stored Symbolization
The third form of symbolization in our framework is persistent or stored communication. Unlike biological and voluntary forms, which are ephemeral and tied to immediate physiology or context, persistent symbols remain in the environment after their production. They serve as externalized records of internal state or environmental knowledge, functioning as time-delayed communication that can be interpreted by others later.
5.1 Insects: Pheromone Trails
Ants provide the paradigmatic case. Foraging ants deposit pheromone trails to mark paths to food sources (Wilson, 1962). These chemical traces encode the knowledge of one ant (“I found food here”) into a durable medium that others can later detect and follow. Importantly, trail strength can be modulated: strong pheromone deposition corresponds to abundant food, while weaker trails fade if the source is depleted. This represents not only storage of information but also a rudimentary external memory system for the colony.
5.2 Mammals: Territorial Scent Marking
Many mammals engage in territorial scent marking, using urine, glandular secretions, or feces to mark boundaries and advertise reproductive status. Wolves, for example, leave scent posts that communicate group presence, dominance, and readiness to mate (Peters & Mech, 1975). These markings persist for days or weeks, broadcasting the internal states of the signallers long after they have moved on.
5.3 Extended Phenotypes: Constructions as Symbols
Animals also build structures that externalize knowledge or state.
•	Spider webs are not only functional traps but also spatial markers that deter other spiders.
•	Beaver dams signal ecological presence and territorial dominance.
•	Termite mounds are collective constructions that embody environmental knowledge (ventilation, climate control) and persist for decades (Turner, 2000).
Richard Dawkins (1982) described such cases as extended phenotypes, external expressions of genes that influence the environment. When interpreted communicatively, they can be seen as persistent symbols that reshape interactions across time.
5.4 Human Writing as Advanced Case
Humans extend persistent symbolization to its most sophisticated form: writing. Unlike scent marks or pheromone trails, writing is arbitrary and conventional, but it shares the same underlying principle: externalizing internal knowledge into a medium that persists and can be reinterpreted later. From cave paintings to digital archives, writing represents the culmination of a trajectory that begins with the simpler persistent symbols of non-human organisms.
5.5 Interpretation
Persistent symbolization is distinct from biological and voluntary forms because it involves communication through time. Symbols are deposited into the environment where they endure, enabling coordination, memory, and influence beyond the immediate moment. This form thus constitutes a bridge between biological communication and the cultural-symbolic systems unique to humans.

6. The Spectrum Framework
Having outlined the three forms of symbolization — biological/automatic, voluntary/selective, and persistent/stored — we can now situate them on a spectrum of increasing control, flexibility, and temporal extension. This framework does not posit hard boundaries between categories but rather emphasizes continuity. Many species exhibit mixtures: for instance, a dog’s raised hackles (biological) may be paired with barking (voluntary) and territorial scent marking (persistent).
6.1 Comparative Spectrum
Form of Symbolization	Definition	Plants	Insects	Mammals	Humans
Biological / Automatic	Involuntary, always-on externalizations of internal state or property	VOC release under stress; floral color/scent signaling reproduction (Karban et al., 2014; Raguso, 2008)	Aposematic coloration; Batesian mimicry (Ruxton et al., 2004)	Piloerection, blushing, pupil dilation (Darwin, 1872/1998)	Autonomic signals (e.g., blushing, pupil dilation)
Voluntary / Selective	Context-sensitive, flexible externalization of state or knowledge	Limited in plants, but some inducible defenses verge on context-specific	Bee waggle dance (von Frisch, 1967)	Barking, alarm calls, food calls, facial expressions (Yin & McCowan, 2004; Templeton et al., 2005; Slocombe & Zuberbühler, 2005)	Speech, gesture, intentional nonverbal displays
Persistent / Stored	Externalized signals that endure beyond the act of production	Root/fungal signaling networks; allelopathic chemicals	Ant pheromone trails; nest architecture (Wilson, 1962)	Scent marking; spider webs; beaver dams; termite mounds (Peters & Mech, 1975; Turner, 2000)	Writing, art, archives, digital storage
6.2 Key Features of the Spectrum
•	Control: Increases from none (automatic) → situational choice (voluntary) → intentional inscription (persistent).
•	Flexibility: Expands from fixed physiological/morphological traits → context-dependent behaviors → arbitrarily encoded conventions (in humans).
•	Temporality: Shifts from immediate signals → momentary but repeatable behaviors → time-extended, environmentally inscribed communication.
6.3 Interpretive Value
This spectrum helps us compare forms of communication across radically different taxa. It demonstrates that symbolization is not a human monopoly but a continuum that begins with involuntary biological signals and culminates in human cultural systems. It also reframes plant signaling, insect pheromones, and mammalian vocalizations as variations on a shared theme: the externalization of inner state or environmental knowledge into perceivable symbols.

7. Theoretical Payoffs
The spectrum of symbolization proposed here has several important implications for biology, semiotics, and the study of communication.
7.1 Continuity Across Life
By framing communication as symbolization — the externalization of inner state or environmental knowledge — we emphasize that symbolic processes are not confined to humans. Plants, insects, mammals, and humans can all be placed along the same continuum. What varies is not whether communication occurs, but the degree of control, flexibility, and temporal persistence in how symbols are produced and maintained.
This perspective reduces the anthropocentric tendency to treat human language as wholly discontinuous from other forms of life. Instead, language can be situated as the most elaborated case of persistent symbolization, building on capacities that are broadly distributed across the tree of life.
7.2 Bridging Ethology and Semiotics
Classical ethology distinguishes between signals and cues (Maynard Smith & Harper, 2003). Semiotic theory distinguishes between indices, icons, and symbols (Peirce, 1931–1958). Both frameworks capture important aspects of communication, but they remain conceptually separate. The symbolization spectrum integrates these traditions by focusing on externalization as the shared process underlying all communicative phenomena.
In doing so, it aligns with the aims of biosemiotics (Hoffmeyer, 2008; Kull, 1999; Sebeok, 2001), but grounds the discussion in concrete ethological and ecological examples, offering a taxonomy that can be tested and refined empirically.
7.3 Niche Construction and External Memory
Persistent symbolization in particular highlights the overlap between communication and niche construction. Pheromone trails, scent marks, and animal-built structures are not just ecological modifications — they are also informational inscriptions. This suggests that organisms engage in rudimentary forms of external memory, offloading knowledge into the environment for later retrieval (Odling-Smee et al., 2003; Dawkins, 1982).
This insight provides a bridge to human cultural evolution. Writing and archival practices can be understood as highly developed forms of the same principle: storing internal knowledge as external symbols that persist across time and generations.
7.4 Reframing Human Uniqueness
The framework also reframes debates about human uniqueness. While humans are exceptional in their ability to manipulate arbitrary symbols recursively and abstractly, they are not unique in the capacity to symbolize. Rather, humans inherit and elaborate on a continuum of symbolization strategies already widespread in life.
This reframing allows us to ask more precise questions: not “Do animals communicate symbolically?” but “To what degree are their symbols automatic, voluntary, or persistent, and how do these compare to human practices?”
7.5 Future Research Directions
•	Comparative studies: Investigating how the same species blends automatic, voluntary, and persistent forms of symbolization (e.g., dogs barking, raising hackles, and marking territory).
•	Cross-domain synthesis: Applying the spectrum to plant biology, insect ecology, and mammalian behavior in parallel.
•	Evolutionary transitions: Examining how automatic symbolization can evolve into voluntary signaling, and how voluntary signals can give rise to persistent externalizations.
•	Human parallels: Tracing continuities between animal persistent symbolization (pheromone trails, scent marking) and the origins of writing and external symbolic storage.

8. Conclusion
Communication is a universal feature of life, but it has too often been described in fragmented ways: alarm calls in primates, pheromone trails in ants, volatile emissions in plants, or human language as a special case. By reframing communication as symbolization — the externalization of inner state or environmental knowledge — we can see these disparate cases as points along a shared continuum.
This paper has proposed a tripartite framework of biological/automatic, voluntary/selective, and persistent/stored symbolization. Biological symbolization captures the involuntary, always-on signals that reveal hidden states, from plant VOCs to aposematic coloration. Voluntary symbolization captures flexible, context-sensitive signals such as barking, alarm calls, or bee dances. Persistent symbolization extends communication through time by inscribing symbols into the environment, from pheromone trails and scent marks to human writing.
The value of this framework lies in its ability to unify perspectives from ethology, semiotics, and niche construction theory. It highlights the continuities across plants, insects, mammals, and humans while clarifying the qualitative differences that emerge with voluntary control and external symbolic storage. In doing so, it situates human language and writing not as anomalies but as elaborations of principles already widespread in life.
Future work can expand on this framework by investigating transitional cases, testing its applicability across taxa, and exploring its implications for the evolution of cognition and culture. At minimum, it offers a conceptual tool for thinking about communication in a way that is comparative, integrative, and non-anthropocentric.
By viewing communication as symbolization, we are reminded that all organisms, in their own ways, make the hidden visible.
